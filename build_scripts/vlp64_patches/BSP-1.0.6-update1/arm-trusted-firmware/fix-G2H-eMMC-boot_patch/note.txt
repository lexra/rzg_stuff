Fix RZ/G2H eMMC boot for VLP64 v1.0.5 and v1.0.6

For the BSP releases of v1.0.5-RT and v1.0.6, a patch in the arm-trusted-firmware code was missing for RZ/G2H that prevented it from booting from eMMC.
While RZ/G2H eMMC boot support exists in v1.0.4, for the v1.0.5 code release the base software repository changed from the R-Car repository to the official ARM repository and new "rzg" subdirectory were created. With all these changes, this eMMC boot patch was missed.

Please apply this patch to your code base if you are using a RZ/G2H and booting from eMMC.
