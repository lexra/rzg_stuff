# RZ/G Stuff
This repository contains random helpful scripts and sample code

### Download
To download everything to your machine, use the command line below:
`$ git clone https://github.com/seebe/rzg_stuff.git`


### Suggested Directory Layout

As a suggestion, you should make a directory called "rzg2" under your /home/user directory (ie, /home/chris/rzg2 ) and place this repository there.

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir rzg2
$ cd rzg2
$ git clone https://github.com/seebe/rzg_stuff.git
```

The scripts and example configurations were designed with the idea that all your projects and build directories are on the same level as this rzg_stuff directory.

For example:

```
├── home
│   └── chris
│       └── rzg2
│           ├── arm-trusted-firmware
│           ├── buildroot
│           ├── renesas-u-boot-cip
│           ├── rzg2_flash_writer
│           └── rzg_stuff

```
