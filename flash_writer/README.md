## Program Bootloaders using internal ROM and Flashwriter

### Description
The RZ/G2 has a built-in ROM for downloading a binary to internal RAM and then executing it.

That downloaded binary is call "Flash Writer" and is supplied with the VLP64 BSP.

This script helps automate the process of programming a SPI flash or eMMC by download image over a serial port to the board.

If using a Renesas evaluation board, you can use the 'sw' command to print out how you need to modify the on-board switches to get into the correct modes.

There are 2 methods to using this script: Command line or GUI menu

### Using the GUI Menu Interface

When you run the flash_writer.sh script without any arguments, it will operate in a GUI menu mode. In this interface, you can select the files you wish to program. You can also start the programming operations.

Please select your **Board** and **Target Flash**  and **Interface** first, then choose the location (**FILES_DIR**) that contains your binary files to program.

Your board configuration setting can be saved in a .ini file. You can using multiple different .ini files. By default, "config.ini" is chosen.

Any GUI settings will be saved in the file "settings.txt",

### Using the Command Line Interface
If you wish to use only the command line, you can see the list of commands by using the following command:

	$ ./flash_writer.sh  h

When using the command line interface, you may either pass all board settings and file names on the command line, or store them in a .ini file and pass the filename on the command line.

When using the command line interface, it is recommended to first make a copy of the example configuration (example_config.ini) and then edit it in a text editor.

	$ cp example_config.ini config.ini
	$ gedit config.ini
	$ ./flash_writer.sh config.ini sw

### Instructions
1. Use either the GUI menu or a .ini config file to selection your board and files.

2. Power **off** the board

3. Determine the **switch settings** for your board. You can find that information in the GUI menu interface, or by using the "sw" command on the command line. Put the device into **SCIF download mode**.

4. Power **on** the board

5. Open a 2nd terminal window and type "cat /dev/ttyUSB0" in order to monitor the output from the board. If you press the RESET button the board, you should see a text message "SCIF Download mode .......  please send !"

6. **Download the flash writer binary**. This must be done first after RESET.

7. Perform the individual commands to download and program the binaries to the board.

## Notes on USB Download mode
USB Download mode is supported for RZ/G2E, RZ/G2N and RZ/G2H devices.
In this mode, the RZ/G USB Function port is used as a USB CDC class USB-serial device when plugged into a host machine.
The HiHope boards were designed to support this.
In Windows, this works fine. However with a Linux PC, there are issues.
