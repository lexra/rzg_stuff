# rzg2_flash_writer version
#    tag: v1.0.4
#   hash: 757e29806159

# Below was how these rzg2_flash_writer binaries were created.
#
# When the binaiers are created, they only enalbe the features that were needed.
# The reason was to keep the .mot size as small as possible to reduce how long it
# takes to download to the board.
# Also, since the RZ/G2E has a small internal RAM, you cannot enable many features
# at once becaue then it will not fit in the internal RAM.


# Start in the rzg2_flash_writer directory
# We will put all the files in a direcotry "z_binaries" and then copy them here.

mkdir -p z_binaries
rm z_binaries/*
