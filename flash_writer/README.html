<h2>Program Bootloaders using internal ROM and Flashwriter</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The RZ/G2 has a built-in ROM for downloading a binary to internal RAM and then executing it.</p>

<p>That downloaded binary is call "Flash Writer" and is supplied with the VLP64 BSP.</p>

<p>This script helps automate the process of programming a SPI flash or eMMC by download image over a serial port to the board.</p>

<p>If using a Renesas evaluation board, you can use the 'sw' command to print out how you need to modify the on-board switches to get into the correct modes.</p>

<p>There are 2 methods to using this script: Command line or GUI menu</p>

<h3>Using the GUI Menu Interface</h3>

<p>When you run the flash_writer.sh script without any arguments, it will operate in a GUI menu mode. In this interface, you can select the files you wish to program. You can also start the programming operations.</p>

<p>Please select your <strong>Board</strong> and <strong>Target Flash</strong>  and <strong>Interface</strong> first, then choose the location (<strong>FILES_DIR</strong>) that contains your binary files to program.</p>

<p>Your board configuration setting can be saved in a .ini file. You can using multiple different .ini files. By default, "config.ini" is chosen.</p>

<p>Any GUI settings will be saved in the file "settings.txt",</p>

<h3>Using the Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>If you wish to use only the command line, you can see the list of commands by using the following command:</p>

<pre style="background-color: #F0F0F0"><code>$ ./flash_writer.sh  h
</code></pre>

<p>When using the command line interface, you may either pass all board settings and file names on the command line, or store them in a .ini file and pass the filename on the command line.</p>

<p>When using the command line interface, it is recommended to first make a copy of the example configuration (example_config.ini) and then edit it in a text editor.</p>

<pre style="background-color: #F0F0F0"><code>$ cp example_config.ini config.ini
$ gedit config.ini
$ ./flash_writer.sh config.ini sw
</code></pre>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Use either the GUI menu or a .ini config file to selection your board and files.</p></li>
<li><p>Power <strong>off</strong> the board</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the <strong>switch settings</strong> for your board. You can find that information in the GUI menu interface, or by using the "sw" command on the command line. Put the device into <strong>SCIF download mode</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Power <strong>on</strong> the board</p></li>
<li><p>Open a 2nd terminal window and type "cat /dev/ttyUSB0" in order to monitor the output from the board. If you press the RESET button the board, you should see a text message "SCIF Download mode .......  please send !"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download the flash writer binary</strong>. This must be done first after RESET.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform the individual commands to download and program the binaries to the board.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes on USB Download mode</h2>

<p>USB Download mode is supported for RZ/G2E, RZ/G2N and RZ/G2H devices.
In this mode, the RZ/G USB Function port is used as a USB CDC class USB-serial device when plugged into a host machine.
The HiHope boards were designed to support this.
In Windows, this works fine. However with a Linux PC, there are issues.</p>
